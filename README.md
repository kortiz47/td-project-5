 Treehouse Tech Degree Project 5: Public API Requests

 This project is going for Exceeds Expectations and is an Random Employee Directory where different employees are loaded every time the page refreshes. Additionally, it has a search feature, modal windows, and previous and next buttons.

 ## How It's Made ##
**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Additional Features:** This project is going for exceeds expectations, and a couple of added features are:
* **Search bar** where users can search the directory of employees by name and see their results populate either when the submit button is clicked or as they type into the search bar
* **Previous and Next Buttons** when a modal window is opened, there are additional previous and next buttons added to the window. They are functional, allowing you to move through the users without having to exit your modal windows. 
    * When you get to the first employee (index of 0), and click the previous button, no errors are displayed in the console and instead the previous button is disabled. The modal window then closes to go back to the gallery of employees.
    * Similarly, when you get to the last employee (index of 11), and click the next button, no errors are displayed in the conosole and the next button is disabled, bringing you back to the gallery.

In our **css/styles.css** file, a few adjustments were made to personalize the employee directory.
